# Case Study — Wellness Studio Documentation Project

This case study describes the process and approach used to create the *Wellness Studio Docs* — a demo SaaS documentation site designed to illustrate end-to-end technical writing capabilities.

---

## 1. Project Overview
**Objective:**  
Create a small yet comprehensive documentation set for a fictitious SaaS product — *Wellness Studio*, a management tool for spas and salons that offers online bookings, staff scheduling, and performance tracking.

**Goals:**
- Demonstrate user-focused documentation for a real-world domain.
- Apply structured writing, consistent tone, and documentation best practices.
- Simulate versioning, release management, and collaboration workflows.

---

## 2. Approach

### a. Research & Planning
- Defined **core personas** (Spa Manager, Receptionist, Customer) to understand user goals and context.  
- Mapped the product’s high-level flows — booking setup, staff scheduling, notifications — to plan the documentation scope.  
- Selected appropriate document types: *Getting Started, User Guide, UI Copy, Style Guide, Release Notes, and Review Process.*

### b. Structure & Tools
- Created documentation in **Markdown** and hosted it using **GitHub Pages**.  
- Followed a **modular structure** where each document serves a clear user purpose.  
- Added a navigation system (`index.html`) for easy browsing.  
- Used **Git** to simulate version control and iterative updates.

### c. Writing Style & Standards
- Maintained **consistent voice and tone** across all documents: friendly, professional, and instructional.  
- Followed a **custom Style Guide** that defines terminology, sentence structure, and accessibility guidelines.  
- Used **UI microcopy** best practices for buttons, messages, and tooltips.  
- Focused on **task-based writing** — guiding users through actions, not theory.

---

## 3. Workflow Simulation
To demonstrate understanding of product documentation processes:
- Created **Release Notes** to show version tracking.  
- Added a **Review Process** document simulating collaboration with Product, Engineering, and UX teams.  
- Used **GitHub Issues** as a feedback channel, mimicking real-world doc review cycles.  
- Emulated Agile workflows where each feature or doc update corresponds to a release ticket.

---

## 4. Outcome
The project represents:
- A structured, realistic documentation system for a SaaS-style platform.  
- Awareness of full documentation lifecycle — from drafting to publishing and versioning.  
- Capability to create documentation that is:
  - **Persona-driven**
  - **Process-aligned**
  - **Tone-consistent**
  - **Tool-aware**

---

## 5. Key Learnings
- Clarity improves when documents are written from the user’s perspective, not the product’s.  
- Maintaining a unified voice across UI text and docs builds user trust.  
- Lightweight, Git-based workflows are ideal for fast-moving product teams.  
- Adding review and release documentation brings structure and accountability to content management.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Add localization examples to demonstrate multilingual documentation handling.  
- Introduce visual aids — diagrams, screenshots, or walkthrough GIFs.  
- Simulate analytics tracking for documentation usage and feedback metrics.  
- Expand UI microcopy library with examples for mobile and desktop interfaces.
