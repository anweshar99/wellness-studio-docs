# Documentation Review Process (Simulated)

This document illustrates a simplified Agile collaboration workflow.

1. **Ticket creation** — Product Manager files a Jira ticket (example: DOC-125) requesting documentation for a new feature.
2. **Drafting phase** — Technical Writer creates content in Markdown within a feature branch (`feature/new-booking-page`).
3. **Peer review** — Another writer reviews via Pull Request comments.
4. **Engineering validation** — Dev lead verifies accuracy.
5. **UX review** — Designer confirms UI names, screenshots.
6. **Publishing** — Writer merges to `main` and updates release-notes.md.
7. **Post-release feedback** — Support team logs user feedback for continuous improvement.
