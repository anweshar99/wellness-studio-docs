# Style Guide — Wellness Studio Docs

This style guide defines the writing principles, tone, and terminology conventions used across the Wellness Studio documentation.

---

## 1. Voice and Tone
**Voice:** Friendly, professional, and confident — like a knowledgeable product specialist helping the user succeed.  
**Tone:** Adjust based on the user’s task:
- **Setup or learning** → encouraging and reassuring.  
- **Error or troubleshooting** → calm and solution-focused.  
- **Success or completion** → brief and positive.  

> Example:
> - ✅ “Your booking was successfully created.”  
> - 🚫 Avoid: “You did it!” (too casual) or “Operation successful.” (too robotic)

---

## 2. Writing Principles
- **Be task-oriented:** Focus on what the user wants to accomplish.  
- **Use short, clear sentences:** Prefer active voice.  
- **Show steps as numbered lists.**  
- **Use headings consistently:** Each topic begins with a clear `H1`, subtopics use `H2` or `H3`.  
- **Avoid product jargon** unless essential; define any necessary term once.  
- **Use bold for UI elements** and *italics* for emphasis.

## 3. Terminology Consistency
| Preferred term | Avoid | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Booking | Appointment | “Booking” matches product UI |
| Staff | Employee | Consistent with internal feature labels |
| Service | Treatment | More generic and scalable |
| Dashboard | Admin panel | Matches Zenoti-style SaaS terminology |

---

## 4. Formatting Standards
- Use **sentence case** for headings and button text.  
- Time format: `09:00 AM` not `9 am`.  
- Date format: `DD MMM YYYY` (e.g., `10 Nov 2025`).  
- Write numbers as digits (`3 staff members`, not `three`).  
- Keep line length ~80 characters in Markdown for readability.  

---

## 5. Accessibility and Inclusivity
- Use gender-neutral terms (they/them).  
- Avoid idioms and cultural references that may confuse global users.  
- Ensure all images (if added later) have descriptive alt text.  

---

## 6. Example Rewrite

**Before:**  
> The user must manually enter the service duration if not configured correctly.

**After:**  
> If a service duration isn’t set, enter it manually under **Settings → Services**.

---

## 7. Voice & Tone Examples (Before / After)

| Scenario | Before | After |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Error Message | "An error occurred." | "Something went wrong — please try again in a few seconds." |
| Success Message | "Operation successful." | "Your booking was confirmed successfully!" |
| Tooltip | "Add buffer time." | "Add time between appointments for cleanup and prep." |

### 🪄 Tip for Writers
When in doubt, write as if explaining the product to a new spa manager seeing the dashboard for the first time.
