# Getting started — Online Booking & Staff Scheduler

**Target persona:** Spa Manager

## Goal
Set up Online Booking and Staff Scheduler so customers can book services online and staff schedules reflect availability.

## Prerequisites
- Admin access to Wellness Studio Dashboard.
- At least one service and one staff profile created.

## Steps

1. **Log in** to the Admin Dashboard (https://app.example.com).
2. Open **Settings > Services**. Confirm services and durations are correct.
3. Open **Staff > Profiles**. For each staff:
   - Add working hours.
   - Add skills (e.g., "Massage", "Facial").
   - Toggle **Enable Online Booking** if staff accepts bookings.
4. Open **Booking > Availability**. Set:
   - Maximum bookings per slot.
   - Buffer time between appointments (optional).
5. Test via **Preview Booking Page**:
   - Select service, choose staff, pick a time slot, and complete a test booking.
6. If notifications required:
   - Settings > Notifications → enable reminder emails and SMS. Add template text.
7. Publish changes.

## Troubleshooting (quick)
- If a staff member does not appear: confirm "Enable Online Booking" and overlapping working hours.
- If time slots show as unavailable: check buffer time and salon-wide blackout dates.
