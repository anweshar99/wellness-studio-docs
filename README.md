# Wellness Studio Docs (Demo SaaS Docs)

**Project:** Demo documentation site for a fictitious SaaS product targeted at salons and spas.  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate technical writing, persona-focused docs, UI microcopy, and Git-based documentation workflow.

## What this repo contains
- `index.html` — simple entry page linking to docs.
- `docs/getting-started.md` — quick-start for a primary persona (Spa Manager).
- `docs/user-guide.md` — step-by-step tasks and examples.
- `docs/ui-copy.md` — sample UI labels, button text, and error messages.
- `docs/personas.md` — short persona definitions to show audience focus.

## Voice & tone
- Voice: friendly, professional, concise.  
- Tone: helpful, task-focused, low-jargon for non-technical product users.

## How to use (quick)
1. Read `docs/personas.md` to choose the target user.  
2. Follow `docs/getting-started.md` to complete first-time setup.  
3. Use `docs/ui-copy.md` for suggested microcopy in UI or release notes.
